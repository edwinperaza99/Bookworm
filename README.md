# Bookworm

Bookworm is an engaging iOS app crafted using SwiftUI, aimed at book enthusiasts who wish to store and manage their book reviews conveniently. Users can effortlessly record their thoughts about books they've read, rate them, and recall details about the authors and titles. Bookworm utilizes SwiftData for robust data storage

## Credits

This project is part of the ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Paul Hudson. I learned how to build this game and further develop my SwiftUI skills through the course.

## Learning Experience

In addition to following the main project instructions, I completed extra challenges provided at the end of the course where there were no instructions.
